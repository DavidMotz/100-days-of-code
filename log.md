# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Reactivated this Github Account and verified it (first time accomplished :D ). Started with a "Pomodoro" Project today. Created an Repository also copied it to Codepen. 

**Thoughts:** I allways was afraid of Github beacause ever since I never got to master it, there are so many things I didn't understand and still dont understand. 

**Link to work:** [Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/DavidMotz/PomodoroTimer)


### Day 2: May 26, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got some help today from a friend who helped me get the timer right. Script not working in [Codepen](https://codepen.io/dmotzparis/pen/gOayEMR) still.

**Toughts:** I think even though I'm not the fastest learner, I'm having some progress wich is great. I think I'll have to work more on the "Programming theory" than on syntax or languages on itself.

**Link to work:** No new link still the one from [Day 1] :)
