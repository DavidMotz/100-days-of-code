# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Reactivated this Github Account and verified it (first time accomplished :D ). Started with a "Pomodoro" Project today. Created an Repository also copied it to Codepen. 

**Thoughts:** I allways was afraid of Github beacause ever since I never got to master it, there are so many things I didn't understand and still dont understand.
